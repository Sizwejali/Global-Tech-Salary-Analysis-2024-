# Global-Tech-Salary-Analysis-2024-
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global tech and data science salaries using Python. This project uncovers how job title, experience level, employment type, company size, geography, and remote work influence salary outcomes.
📁 Project Overview

This analysis aims to answer one key question:

“What drives salary differences across global tech and data roles?”

Using a real-world dataset, the notebook walks through:

Data cleaning & initial inspection

Salary distributions & medians

Salary by job title

Salary by employment type

Company size & employment type dynamics

Experience level salary differences

Year-over-year salary trends (with COVID impact)

Remote work patterns

Geographic comparisons

The analysis uses pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.

🔍 Key Insights
1. Job title strongly influences salary

Engineering-heavy roles (ML Engineers, Data Engineers) earn notably higher median salaries compared to analyst roles.

2. Experience level is the strongest predictor of pay

Executive-level (EX) compensation sharply spikes relative to all other levels.

Entry-level roles show tight salary ranges with minimal variance.

3. Company size affects the employment type, not just salary

Larger companies tend to rely more on full-time workers.
Smaller companies have higher proportions of contract and freelance roles.

4. COVID-19 (2020–2021) created a temporary dip

Your analysis reflects a measurable drop in median salaries attributed to global economic slowdown.

5. Remote work patterns differ by company size

Large companies: more zero-remote roles

Medium companies: most hybrid

Small companies: higher full-remote adoption

6. Geographic salary gaps remain high

North America salaries remain consistently higher across most roles and experience levels.
